# Stepper_Motor_and_Driver
Interfacing to a stepper motor and driver on an arduino.

# Running the project
To flash the code to an Arduino, place the compile script and Stepper.c files into the same directory, and edit the compile script so the directory name matches the name of the sirectory you placed both files into. Then, open a terminal in that directory and call python compile_script.py
